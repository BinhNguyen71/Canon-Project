[Ten Problems with Free Trade](http://economyincrisis.org/content/ten-problems-free-trade)
This gives an overview of the arguments against free-trade. Just read the thematic sentences in bold; most of them look into the eligibility of Ricardo's theory.

[The Importance of Trade Liberalization for Developing Countries](http://www.cipe.org/blog/2013/08/05/the-importance-of-trade-liberalization-for-developing-countries/#.V_j1P-h96hc)
Clearly pro-free trade article with a nice explanation of comparative advantage and some references to possibly useful articles. References to the cases of Chile and Bolivia. Focus on developing countries

[Trade liberalisation and firm productivity, case of India](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2004/wp0428.pdf)
Long paper on the case of India. Possibly useful as a reference.
