#Liberalization of Trade on Growth in Developing Countries

That the benefits of opening up to trade are subject to discussion, is becoming increasingly clear with controversy arising around free trade agreements such as TTIP and CETA in Europe, and TPP in the US. 
While elementary economic theory is quite clear in stating that free trade is good for everyone, if only to increase economic efficiency. 
But as with any theory, the question should be asked whether this can actually be observed in practice. 
Perhaps more sophisticated theories might better capture the mechanisms at work when countries open up to international trade.
Because extensive trade liberalizations have been occurring in developing countries far more often in the recent past than in already developed countries, the examples and studies represented in this canon will mostly concern these developing countries. 
It may also be argued that developing countries will face the worst of the disadvantages of free trade, as these are likely to face competition by the developed countriesâ€™ more competitive industries.

This canon will provide you with references to models of international economics, both elementary and some more advanced ones, and study some identifiable cases of countries opening up to trade. 
By doing so, it should enable you to form an informed opinion on the topic of international trade and its implications. 
(It will also discuss a couple of questions that you might have in more detail. "Insert research questions here")
