Long story short, Economic Integration is achieved mainly from trade liberalisation. What we question here is, however, to what extent
does opening up the economy to the foreign countries promote effective Economic Development.
Under the empirical evidences of trade liberalisation we address to the case of the Pacific Arch. A process in which we can distinguish
3 different phases:
	
  - The case of Japan; (not an example of trade liberalization, quite the opposite)
	- The Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan)
	- The 2nd Generation of Industrialised countries (Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and China)

The mentioned region was not exactly wealthy nor in resources and capital. Nevertheless the labor is abundant, disciplined, capable and
rather cheap.

We ought to refer South Korea (now will be referred simply as Korea) as an example in which trade liberalisation effectively promoted a
sustained growth of the national economy. We are talking about a country which is poor in natural resources with a scarce cultivable
land. A country composed by a widely agrarian and feudalistic society. In the early 60’s unemployment and poverty were reaching extreme
levels. Well South Korea is now one of the highly industrialised economies of the world, representing a fair share of the world’s trade
and a already well established developed country.

The gradual growth of Korea was outlined in three different policy steps: (1)Import Substitution, 1954 - 1960; (2) Outward orientation,
1961-1979; (3) Balance and consolidation.

The first step taken is a clear change of route for the Korean economy, switching from a Import- Substituting country to a Exporting
intensive country. In raw terms, as if the former industries are boosted in such way that it allows openness to other countries.

In the early 60’s Korea started by eliminating tariffs on imported inputs and capital goods given that these promote an export expansion
industry. As in Westphal and Kim (1977) this was the most relevant policy towards exports-expansion. The coming decades, starting in
1970, were characterised by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)- now known as the World Trade Organisation (WTO)- sets
promoted for global tariff reduction, namely the Kennedy Round and the Tokyo Round which allowed for a gradual reduction of tariff rates
from around 40 percent all the way to 13 percent. 

Lower tariffs facilitated specialisation which allowed for an increase in total factor productivity, in raw terms, productivity. Also
with the tariffs being lower it enabled the import of investment goods which allows for capital accumulation - essential for a solid
industrialisation process. These factors are generally associated with an increase in per capita GDP as was the case. The Korean
government made the conditions favourable for the export oriented sectors, so they could compete against the highly industrialised USA,
UK and even Japan. As stated in Westphal(1990): “Korea’s industrial performance owes a great deal to the government’s promotional
policies toward exports and to its initiatives in targeting industries for development. If nothing else, policies towards exports have
created an atmosphere--rare in the Third World--in which businessmen could be certain that the economic system would respond to and
subsequently reward their efforts aimed at expanding and upgrading exports.” 

Looking at South Korea now we have a solidified nation. One in which the income gap is rather low. The industries here located tend to
use state-of-the-art technology which promotes also higher levels of education - ultimately resulting in a skilled and high-income
labor.

As further evidence for the benefits of free trade we propose the not so successful case of India during approximately the same time
period. Even though India managed to increase its GDP growth rate (between 1950 and 1980) this increase in the growth rate was nowhere
near that witnessed in Korea. The focus on protectionism in India was such that in the 1970’s all imports went under strict license,
reaching a level of nearly 3 percent of the GDP in 1975/76.


All in all during 1960-1980 the average per capita GDP growth was 6.3 percent for Korea and only 1.1 percent in India. While Korea
managed to turn towards an outward-oriented trade regime India followed a protectionist approach. The fact that the Indian government
followed an import-substituting policy did not allow for at least the import of inputs of higher quality such that the efficiency levels
could be increased.


*In contrast to the Asian countries, Latin American countries such as Brazil and Mexico did not observe the same favorable effects of trade growth:*
**(Revenga, 1994, “Employment and Wage Effects of Trade Liberalization: The Case of Mexican Manufacturing”)**
In Mexico, a 10% reduction in tariff levels lead to a 2-3% reduction in employment and an average 3-4% decline in real wages; the wage
differential between skilled and unskilled workers intensely increased, while real wages of unskilled workers declined. The most
fundamental reason pointed out for this result was the flexibility of the predominant wage. 

**(Mesquita & Najberg, 2000, “Trade liberalization in Brazil: Creating or exporting jobs?”)**
Brazil is a resource-abundant country, and Brazilian exports are concentrated in the products with the lowest degree of processing. The
trade liberalization that took place in the early 1990s caused a short-term 32% drop in employment in capital-intensive industries due
to a sharp increase in productivity. Furthermore, as the domestic market opened its borders to new import-products, the export
performance of the country degraded, causing roughly a 13% decline in the employment of labor-intensive industries. 

**(DESA Working Paper No. 5, 2005, “Trade Liberalization and Employment”)**
Contrary to the predictions of economic models such as the Hecksher-Ohlin and the Stolper-Samuelson model, wage inequality increased in
several countries after trade liberalization. The possibility of outsourcing and relocation of labor-intensive production processes from
advanced to developing countries play also part in this phenomenon. This is not to say that the models are necessarily invalid, since
Asian countries had quite an opposite experience, but rather to indicate that country-specific and contingent factors are important when
discussing the benefits of trade liberalization. The difference between Latin American and Asian countries was that in Latin American
countries there were problems of macroeconomic management, a significantly unequal distribution of assets, and an overdependence on
external resources. Asian countries instead, chose to selective promote export policies. Not all countries are able to successfully
implement such interventionist strategies and promote infant industries with the highest potentials, because efficient administration
and strong political positions are required, conditions that hardly apply in developing countries.

**(Sachs and Warner, 1995, Natural Resource Abundance and Economic Growth)**
**(Dollar, 1992, “Outward-Oriented Developing Economies Really Do Grow More Rapidly”)**
These two studies had a high influence in forming the view that lowering trade barriers through national policies can generate growth
faster for the country. Dollar advocated the benefits of free trade using a cross-section analysis for a sample of 95 countries between
the period of 1976 and 1985 in order to demonstrate that growth is negatively correlated with real exchange rate distortion and real
exchange variability, which are inextricably linked to a close economy. Sachs and Warner had similar results when measuring the
relationship of openness and growth. In their cross-section analysis they used 70 countries as a sample, accounting for the level of
average tariffs, political systems, and market power and structure.

**(Rodriguez and Rodrick, 1999, “Trade Policy and Economic Growth: A Sceptic’s Guide to the Cross-National Evidence”)**
The findings of the above two studies have been questioned by a convincing critique of Rodriguez and Rodrick, who find the selected
indicators of “openness” seriously flawed. The main argument is that the measures of trade barriers are not reliable enough, and that
they are also highly correlated with other sources of poor economic performance. If this argument holds, then the proposition that trade
liberalization is automatically leads to higher growth is not undisputable.

**(Dollar and Kraay, 2001, “Trade, Growth, and Poverty”)**
A group of countries is identified as the “post-1980 globalizers” that have seen both a considerable raise in trade and a significant
decline in tariffs from 1970 until 1990. The paper claims that despite the decline of growth in developed and other undeveloped
countries, the “post-1980 globalizers” accelerated their growth rates during that period. The paper is admittedly more persuading on the
effects of trade expansion on growth than on the effects of trade policy per se.

**(Rodrick, 2001, “The Global Governance of Trade as if Development really Mattered”)**
The paper denotes that the work of Dollar and Kraay (2001) is also flawed by applying an “arbitrary set of selection criteria to their
sample of countries”. Rodrick criticized the combining of a policy measure with an outcome measure in selecting countries that Dollar
and Kraay did as “conceptually inappropriate”. He also denoted that “policy makers do not directly control the level of trade… the tools
at the disposal of governments are tariff and non-tariff barriers, not import or export levels”. This is indeed worth noting, since the
countries in the sample that implemented deep trade liberalization had lower rates of economic growth than than the countries who just
expanded their trade volume. Another point of Rodrick was that China and India passed trade reforms a decade after their growth
acceleration, and therefore their growth rates are is not attributable to trade liberalization.

**(Greenaway, Morgan and Wright, 1998, “Trade Liberalization and Growth in Developing Countries”)**
This recent review of the empirical evidence on the effects of trade liberalization concludes that country circumstances play the
highest role on whether growth declines or increases. For example, there are short-run costs of adjustment to trade liberalization (“a
J-curve type response”), such as an observed increase in current account deficits in spite of an increase in exports. Overall, the mixed
results that the paper presents indicate that the impact of trade liberalization is highly influenced by the type of the liberalization
program, pre-existing distortions in the trade regime and the flexibility of markets.

**Some Conclusions**
In general, there is no question for the beneficial role of trade liberalization in terms of its growth, employment and distributional
implications. The advocates of trade liberalization support that extensive and rapid trade liberalization measures will bring
proportional benefits. However, such claims rest on the assumptions such as the existence of perfect competition, fully employed
resources (including labor), constant returns to scale in production, and that trade will always be balanced. Notwithstanding, the
assumptions in question do not materialize in the real world, where, especially in developing countries, market imperfections are common
and industrial production is characterized by economies of scale. Moreover, according to endogenous growth theories, trade restrictions
can also produce higher rates of growth of output, conditionally that the aforementioned restrictions promote technologically dynamic
sectors over others.
