#Free Trade in Developing Countries

Our canon focusses on the pros and cons of free trade for developing countries. First we will describe the historical evolution of basic concepts of free trade, such as the **Heckscher-Ohlin model** and **Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage**. What follows is an overview of relevant literature.

   The formulated theories help to answer our key questions: Does free trade stimulate economic growth in developing countries? How does FDI affect an economy? Have international trade agreements seen success? Until when does free trade block higher technology industrialization in sub-developed and developing countries? And can developing countries utilize exchange rates to improve competitiveness?
