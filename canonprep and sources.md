[Do free trade agreements actually increase members' international trade?](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199606000596)

**Section 2: advanced models**

[Helping infant economies grow](http://www.jstor.org/stable/30034630?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
Interesting theory and easy to grasp. Maybe we can build on this as I find the conclusion/assumptions rather strong.

**Section 3: "pro" cases and studies"**

[Trade liberalisation and firm productivity, case of India](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2004/wp0428.pdf)
Long paper on the case of India. Possibly useful as a reference.

**[Stylized Facts for trade liberalization](https://beingclassicallyliberal.liberty.me/the-empirical-case-for-free-trade/)**
(i) Some interesting graphs and tables that give us an overview of the stylized facts. Many pro-trade arguments with references to other studies.

*Does free trade stimulate economic growth in developing countries?*
- Jeffrey Frankel and David Romer -  "Does Trade Cause Growth", American Economic Review, June 1999. https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.89.3.379
Examine the effects of trade on income. A rise of 1% in the ratio of trade to GDP increases income per person by at least 0.5%. “Trade appears to raise income by spurring the accumulation of physical and human capital and by increasing output for given levels of capital”. Similar result can be observed from within-country trade. The data is from the IFS Direction of Trade statistics for 1985, and cover trade among 63 countries. [Feyrer (2009)](http://www.nber.org/papers/w15557) finds similar results (from stylized facts)

**Section 4: "con" cases and studies**

[Mexico case](https://www.kent.ac.uk/economics/documents/research/papers/2004/0403.pdf)
paper on the case of Mexico, where trade liberalization apparently did not work out very well

[Ten Problems with Free Trade](http://economyincrisis.org/content/ten-problems-free-trade)
This gives an overview of the arguments against free-trade. Just read the thematic sentences in bold; most of them look into the eligibility of Ricardo's theory.

First three are good points, I (Joep) think (third may not be so appropriate for developing countries). I do find the source very questionable

[Trade and income inequality in developing countries](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X08002222)
Paper studying empirical evidence of increasing income inequality in developing countries as a result of liberalized trade. Also discusses the link to theory, the predictions of the Hecksher-Ohlin model and the Stolper-Samuelson effect.

Above paper draws (at first sight) the exact oposite conclusion as [Measuring the Unequal Gains from Trade](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/akhandelwal/papers/mugft_FINAL.pdf). Might be worth looking into.

[The Importance of Trade Liberalization for Developing Countries](http://www.cipe.org/blog/2013/08/05/the-importance-of-trade-liberalization-for-developing-countries/#.V_j1P-h96hc)
Clearly pro-free trade article with a nice explanation of comparative advantage and some references to possibly useful articles. References to the cases of Chile and Bolivia. Focus on developing countries

[FDI in Africa (2005)](https://www.globalpolicy.org/images/pdfs/unctadreport.pdf)
UN report on the role of FDI on economic development in Africa (obviously). I'd suggest a look at box 2, section B3 and section D.

Impact of trade liberalization in developing countries: manufacturing employment increased (except for transition economies, where employment decreased at a slower rate than the ones without trade liberalization), private costs are mostly small, fiscal deficits and inflation decreased.

“Globalization has generally supported poverty reduction. Backward economies that integrate with the world tend to grow rapidly; the poor within these societies are among the key beneficiaries of globalization.”

*Have international trade agreements seen success?*
- Harley Shaiken, "The NAFTA Paradox"
http://clas.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/shared/docs/tertiary/BRLASSpring2014-Shaiken.pdf 
NAFTA is the first regional trade agreement to link economies at such sharply different levels of development as Mexico on the one hand and the United States and Canada on the other. The paradox: rising productivity and falling wages.
- Scott L. Baier and Jeffrey H. Bergsrtrand, “Economic determinants of free trade agreements”
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199603000795 
Free Trade Agreement’s success determinants are: (i) the closer in distance are two trading partners; (ii) the more remote a natural pair is from the ROW; (iii) the larger and more similar economically (i.e. real GDPs) are two trading partners by exploiting economies of scale in the presence of differentiated products; (iv) the greater the difference in capital–labor endowment ratios between two countries due to the gains from traditional comparative advantages; and (v) the less is the difference in capital–labor endowment ratios of the member countries relative to that of the ROW due to less inter-industry trade diversion. 
- Shandre M. Thangavelu  and Aekapol Chongvilaivan, “Free Trade Agreements, Regional Integration and Growth in ASEAN”
http://paftad.org/files/33/Thangavelu%20&%20Chongvilaivan.pdf 
The ASEAN “brought about numerous advantages to the member countries in terms of enlarged market size, enhanced competitiveness, and increasing intra- and extra- flows of goods, services and capital investments, on top of rapid economic growth. However, several major challenges facing the ASEAN countries remain, including diminishing marginal returns to economic integration; importance of non-tariff barriers to trade; and lack of leadership among signatories.”
- Chandrima Sikdar and Biswajit Nag, “Impact of India-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement: A cross-country analysis using applied general equilibrium modelling” - UNICEF
http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/AWP%20No.%20107.pdf 
India’s exports to ASEAN increase substantially. However, India experiences a welfare loss due to both allocative inefficiency and negative terms of trade effect. In the ASEAN region, most countries gain positive welfare gains except Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and the Philippines. “This welfare gain by ASEAN countries is primarily due to their improved terms of trade. The simulation results also reveal that the rest of the world experiences a significant market share loss in India and the ASEAN members. After full trade liberalization, India’s allocative efficiency will increase, but the terms of trade effect will worsen continuously and remain negative. India will be able to arrest the worsening in terms of trade once the gain in allocative efficiency is used to improve productivity in the export-oriented sectors as well as achieve economies of scale.”
- Calestous Juma and Francis Mangeni, “The Benefits of Africa’s New Free Trade Area”, 2015
http://www.technologyandpolicy.org/2015/06/11/the-benefits-of-africas-new-free-trade-area/#.WACcN4N96Ul 
“The TFTA will benefit Africa in at least six mutually reinforcing ways:
(i) The conclusion of the agreement will generate the impetus for the creation of similar arrangements in western Africa, bringing economic powerhouses such as Nigeria into a continental free trade area. 
(ii) A much larger market whose free flow of goods and services will help to maintain economic growth at 6-7% per year. 
(iii) The TFTA will serve as an impetus for investment in Africa’s cross-border infrastructure. 
(iv) The prospects for the larger markets and supporting infrastructure will spur industrial development
(v) The signal of larger markets will also help to stimulate trade in services. The first beneficiary is likely to be the financial sector, which will be able to lend to larger industrialists seeking to benefit from economies of scale
(vi) Small African countries will no longer be restricted to producing their traditional products.”
